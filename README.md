# dotfiles
This version of my dotfiles is working towards a more generic setup. See v1 tag for the mac version.

# New Setup
You'll need to manually install [The Silver Searcher](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher) using whatever package management system is appropriate. After that, run the following command.
```
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChuckLangford/dotfiles/main/dotfile-setup.sh)"
```
